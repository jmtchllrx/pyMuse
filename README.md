# pyMuse
Simple python library/app for managing music directory

All this program will do currently is give simple prompts and output a playlist of the genres you input. It will display all found tracks and allows you to filter out artists or albums, then rename the playlist file. Uses normal .m3u format and saves the file in the directory you run in.


Use:

Run ~/src/pyMuseConsole.py [genre] [genre] etc


TODO

Capability to change directory structure based on arbitrary genre/artist/album/title tags

Think of revolutionary way to organize music the way I want


Using the hsaudiotag library

# pyMuse
Simple python library/app for managing music directory

All this program will do currently is give simple prompts and output a playlist of the genre you input.

Use:
Run src/pyMuseConsole.py
Recommend that you run from top directory of your music library and not change defaults

TODO
Capability to change directory structure based on arbitrary genre/artist/album/title tags
Think of revolutionary way to organize music the way I want


Using the hsaudiotag library
